# NLSE
In this repository, we provide codes for simulating the nonlinear Schrödinger equations for different optical regimes.

The propagation of light in a nonlinear medium is described by a Nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). Depending on the intensity of the light field amplitude, the system's response which is given by its susceptibility will have a different functional form.

Here we implement the NLSE for three different regimes: Kerr medium ($\chi^{(3)}$ regime), that is, when the refractive index varies linearly with the intensity; the $\chi^{(3)}+\chi^{(5)}$ regime which is up to second order in the intensity, and finally, the most general saturating nonlinearity.

There are codes for solving the NLSE in one and two dimensions for the above-mentioned regimes, for both imaginary and real time. The former will be used when we are interested in assesing the groundstate of the system while the latter will be used for studying the real-time dynamics. These codes were used for the numerical simulations of the NLSE's analysed in the work of Ref [1].

All codes have been adapted from templates available on the webpage of the XMDS project[2].
